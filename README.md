## What is it?

**Where You Left Off** is a website backend and frontend developed on Laravel and AngularJS. It is intended to work as a reminder service for various forms of media, primarily focusing on books and video games.

With busy lives, it can be difficult sometimes to remember where one left off on any number of things. Various tasks, responsibilities and media plot lines vie for valuable memory space in our brains.

**Where You Left Off** seeks to solve this problem by allowing a user to get a quick (or thorough) reminder of where things left off in a particular media plot line.

This includes small chapter reviews, "when we last left our heroes" and "what has happened so far" summaries. Great examples of this are already used in television where episodes of long-running series are preceded with topical reviews of the history of the show.

## Writing a good review

As anything else, writing a good and useful review is an art form. It is important to remember that **Where You Left Off** is not intended as a place to share *opinions* regarding a work, but a *review* of what has happened.

Therefore, a review should focus on the actions and emotions presented in the book without offering deeper interpretation of the work. It should be in short form and should not take much effort to peruse so that the user can get back into reading quickly. Plagiarizing the work itself is unhelpful and undesirable as it generally does not fit into this format.

There are two different forms of reviews that are likely to be sought out by a user: general and targeted.

A **targeted** review is one that specifically targets the next chapter or section of the plot. This type of review points out events or facts that may have happened far back in the story but will be referenced again shortly. Great examples of this exist in the pre-episode reviews seen in some long running television shows.

Targeted reviews are possibly best written immediately after reading a particular chapter or before reading the chapter during a subsequent read-through of the work, and would include anything that needed to be re-referenced to understand the events contained within it.

A **general** review is one that gives an overview of only the recent events or facts. This type of review may be written by the user themselves with no foresight into the forthcoming story to serve as a simple reminder.

### When last we left our heroes

If a user has a good memory or has recently left the story, it is generally only necessary to get a small reminder of the last thing that happened. Such a review should focus on the most recent storyline and any storyline(s) that may have recently preceded it.

**For example:** The previous chapter followed Susan's adventures through the mystical forest. Half way through the chapter, the plot shifted to Greg's on-going relationship conflict. A good short review would include a summary of the last things the chapter had to say about both Susan and Greg, not just Greg or Susan individually.

## Development

The latest version can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/Worthwelle/WhereYouLeftOff).

### Milestones

#### Alpha

It should be assumed that upgrading from one alpha version to a new alpha version will break the database.

**0.1** - A functioning API implementing the features that will be the foundation of the software.

**0.2** - A simple HTML5 web interface to use the existing foundation features.

**0.3** - An enhanced HTML5 web interface utilizing AngularJS to add fluidity to existing features.

**0.4** - Introduce administrator and moderator roles in API and web. (Mostly behind the scenes.)

#### Beta

Current beta code will be hosted live for testing, but will not be available on the [official website](http://whereyouleftoff.com/).

**0.5+**

## Documentation

Documentation will, eventually, be available in the development repository.
